Class Exercise #3

Name: 

Describe how your performed your ducking and any challenges you faced:

My ducking is performed by changing the gain of the background wav file.  I also inserted a Glide in between the gain.  The glide should make the transition from one gain value over a period of time.  In my program that is 250 milliseconds.  

The challenge I faced was figuring out when the voice files ended.  From the professors note on Piazza I figured out how to set the loops to pause once they are finished.  I used the isPaused method then to set background volume back to higher value once the voices are both paused.
