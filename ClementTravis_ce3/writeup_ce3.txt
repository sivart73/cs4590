Class Exercise #3

Name: 

Describe how your performed your ducking and any challenges you faced:

My ducking is performed by changing the gain of the background wav file.  I also inserted a Glide in between the gain.  The glide should make the transition from one gain value over a period of time.  In my program that is 250 milliseconds.  

The challenge I faced was figuring out when the voice files ended.  From the professors note on Piazza about setEndListener I figured out how to set the background sound back up when the voice file ends.
